        <h1>Hi! I'm Leonard Decena</h1>
        <p>
            As a passionate self-taught web developer, I bring ideas to life through code. My journey began with a
            curiosity for how things work and evolved into a love for creating intuitive and dynamic web applications.
            From the intricacies of mechanical engineering to the fluidity of front-end frameworks, my path has been
            anything but conventional.
